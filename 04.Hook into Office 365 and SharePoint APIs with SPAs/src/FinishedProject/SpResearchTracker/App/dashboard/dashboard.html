  <h2>Understanding the Reference Application Makeup</h2>
  <p>
    This is a single page application (SPA) that is launched from a ASP.NET MVC application hosted in <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/web-sites/">Microsoft Azure Web Site</a>. An application has also been created in Azure Active Directory and granted permissions within SharePoint Online within Office 365. In order to launch the SPA, the user must authenticate using a valid Organization ID (OrgID) from their Office 365 subscription. The Azure Active Directory that the OrgID belongs to is in the same Azure subscription that contains the ASP.NET MVC application running in the Azure Web Site. All communication with Office 365 is handled by the ASP.NET WebAPI interface within the ASP.NET MVC application.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a user logs in, the ASP.NET application first ensures the necessary lists reside in the specified SharePoint Online site.
